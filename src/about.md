## Work

I've 6 years of professional development in 3 different startups, where I mostly
worked remotely. I started as a **frontend** engineer, where I expanded my knowledge 
of **UI/UX**, and transitioned to developing **full-stack** solutions. 
My favourite technologies are Clojure and Clojurescript for
server and client, PostgreSQL for the database, Linux on the server. I also have
a strong experience in Javascript (React/Node), Python and CSS.


### Prev Positions

- [**Sysdig**](https://sysdig.com/) open source UIs and enterprise monitoring dashboard
- [**CloudAcademy**](https://cloudacademy.com/) platform UI and data science for the e-learning app
- [**VUGO**](https://www.vugoentertainment.com/) UI of the video streaming platform and mobile solution

## This website

This website is written using Markdown and styled with SCSS. Some JS is used for
the theme switcher. Build with **jekyll**. Code blocks are managed by Codemirror,
but there is no node in the repository. Sources are on Github and is served via 
Netlify. I'm using [my own yekill manager](https://github.com/elias94/cljk) written
in [Clojure](https://tryclojure.org/).
