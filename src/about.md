## Work

I've 6 years of professional development in 3 different startups, where I mostly
worked remotely. I started as a **frontend** engineer, where I expanded my knowledge 
of **UI/UX**, and transitioned to developing **full-stack** solutions. 
My favourite technologies are Clojure and Clojurescript for
server and client, PostgreSQL for the database, Linux on the server. I also have
a strong experience in Javascript (React/Node), Python and CSS.
