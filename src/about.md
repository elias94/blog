My favourite technologies are Clojure and Clojurescript for
server and client, PostgreSQL for the database, linux on the server. I also have
a strong experience in Python, Javascript (React) and CSS.


### Prev Positions

- **VUGO** UI of the video streaming platform and the mobile solution

- **Sysdig** created open source UIs and worked on the monitoring dashboard

## This website

This website is written using Markdown and styled with SCSS. Some JS is used for
the theme switcher. Build with **jekyll**. Code blocks are managed by Codemirror,
but there is no node in the repository. Sources are on Github and is served via 
Netlify. I'm using [my own yekill manager](https://github.com/elias94/cljk) written
in [Clojure](https://tryclojure.org/).
